# util-express-static


## What is it ?

Launch a nodejs express webserver to serve static files. This is not for production, just to spin up a websever whenever you need for your dev.

### Install

To start clone the project first, then make sure you have Node.js *4.x* or higher.

You'll need `yarn` to install the dependencies we locked in via the `yarn.lock` checked in to this repo.

You can install `yarn` if you haven't done so via `brew install yarn`.

Once you have `yarn` installed, just run

```
$ yarn install
```

from the project folder. Once installed you can start by running,

```
$ yarn start
```
